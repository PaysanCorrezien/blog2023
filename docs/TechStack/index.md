# Introduction 

This part is about all the tools i'm using.

I'm quite interested on `productivity`.
As someone spending a lot of time behind my computer, probably way too much, i'm always eager to find new way to be more efficient at what im doing.

I spend a lot of time optimizing my setup, and i will share some of it here.

My `dotfiles` can be found on my github directly if you want to take a direct look.
