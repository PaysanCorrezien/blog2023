# About This Site

This website is built using a stack of modern web technologies to ensure speed, ease of use, and *ease of deployment*

## Choice 

The main reason that made me use the tool i used, is the research to:
- Write easily
  I'm using Obsidian Daily so the content should be Markdown based.
- Deploy easily
I don't want to SSH to a server to push an article.
- Minimal infrastructure Management
 There is none.
- Cost
 Only bought a domain name, 10$.

Now, Here's a brief overview of the tech stack:

## Development

- **Docusaurus:** A modern static website generator that makes it easy to build documentation websites. Work also for blog in my case.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used by Docusaurus
- **Markdown and MDX:** Lightweight markup languages that make it easy to write content.

## Deployment

- **GitHub:** Hosts the source code in a github repo
- **Vercel:** A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Free tier is enough for hosting this site. 

## Domain Management

- **Namecheap:** Manages the domain name and DNS settings for this site.

## Code

The code for this website is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/paysancorrezien/blog2023). Feel free to explore the code, open issues, and contribute.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are handled by Vercel. Whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, a new build is triggered, and the updated site is automatically deployed to Vercel.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the developers and communities behind these technologies for making this easy to publish a website today.
